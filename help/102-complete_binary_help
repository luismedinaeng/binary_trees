# Check if a binary tree is complete

Compute the height of the tree

Check the number of nodes of each level

level 0: 1 node
level 1: 2 nodes
level 2: 4 nodes
level 3: 8 nodes
...
level n: 2^n nodes

If the height > level and some level does not follow the pattern, then the binary tree is not complete (Every level of a complete binary tree is completely filled, except possibly the last)

For check the order of the nodes, assign numbers depending on the number of childs

No childs:    0
left-child:   1
right-child: -1
both-childs:  2

Check every child of the nodes and using the above enumaration, determining if the actual tree is complete or not.
